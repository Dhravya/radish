## 👀 What is this? Why?

`Radish` is a super fast drop-in replacement of the in memory key-value store redis, built with golang.

Why?
Redis recently (Last week, as of Mar 25 2024) changed their license to a [dual 'source-available' license](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39772562) - which means that it can't be used for commercial purposes without paying for a license. Everyone hated it. This is a problem for many companies and developers who use redis in their projects.

And, I was kinda bored and wanted to learn golang properly, so I built this.

Should you use this in production? Probably, probably not. It's not battle tested yet, but i (as a single person team) have tried to do my best to make it as reliable as possible.

I even made a cute mascot (Godis crushing Redis)

Annddd all i ask in return is a little ⭐ so that i dont have to rely on twitter for my dopamine hit.

## Having fun

This IS compatible with the existing redis tooling and client libraries! Try it out with some of them.

For eg.

```
npm i -g redis-cli
```

(make sure the server is running - docker is the easiest and fastest way)

```
❯ rdcli
127.0.0.1:6379> incr mycounter
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> incr mycounter
(integer) 2
127.0.0.1:6379> set foo bar
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get foo
bar
127.0.0.1:6379> get bar
(nil)
```
